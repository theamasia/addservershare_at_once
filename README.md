This PowerShell script provides a user-friendly interface for connecting to network shares on a remote server and mapping them to local drive letters. Here's a detailed description of its functionality:

## User Input and Authentication

The script begins by prompting the user for two key pieces of information:

1. The IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the server they want to connect to.
2. Login credentials for that server, which are securely collected using the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.

## Share Discovery

Once connected, the script retrieves a list of available shares on the specified server:

- It uses the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to query the server for its shared folders.
- The script filters out system shares (those ending with $) and the IPC$ share to focus on user-accessible shares.
- If any errors occur during this process, such as connection issues or insufficient permissions, the script provides appropriate error messages.

## Share Selection

The script then presents the user with a numbered list of available shares:

- Each share is displayed with its name and description.
- Users can select multiple shares by entering their corresponding numbers, separated by commas.

## Drive Mapping

For each selected share, the script attempts to map it to an available drive letter:

- It checks for unused drive letters, starting from 'C' and moving up the alphabet.
- The script uses the `New-PSDrive` cmdlet to create persistent mapped drives.
- If successful, it confirms the mapping with a message showing the share path and assigned drive letter.
- If there are no more available drive letters, or if any errors occur during mapping, appropriate messages are displayed.

## Error Handling and User Feedback

Throughout its execution, the script provides clear feedback:

- Successful operations are highlighted in green.
- Errors and warnings are displayed in red or yellow, respectively.
- The script handles various potential issues, such as invalid selections or network errors.

By automating these steps, the script simplifies the process of connecting to and mapping network shares, making it more efficient and less error-prone than manual methods. It's particularly useful in environments where users frequently need to connect to different network resources across various servers.
